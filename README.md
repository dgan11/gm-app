# GM App

decentralized app (Solidity Smart Contract + Front end) where users can connect their wallet and send a "gm" message to all others building/learning in the web3.0 space.

The App handles
- Authentication of a user by metamask
- Writing to the smart contract, storing messages on chain, and emitting events whenever an update happens so the app updates in real time/without refreshing
- Reading the smart contract for values (Total # of gms sent, address of the last person to say gm, & all the messages that have been sent so far)
